Slides and example code from a training presentation on Scalaz 7

Notes
=====

1. Slides use imprecise language when discussing default typeclass
   instances (e.g., Option[A] *is* Monoid if A is Semigroup).  When
   presenting, be sure to differentiate default typeclasses from
   alternatives.  Prefer the longer "there exists a Monoid instance...".
